                                Cookies are small bits of text sent by our servers to your computer or device when you access our services.
                                They are stored in your browser and later sent back to our servers so that we can provide contextual content.
                                Without cookies, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.
                                We use them to support your activities on our website. For example, your session (so you don't have to login again) or your shopping cart.

                                Cookies are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current activity on our website (the pages you have
                                visited), your language and country, which enables us to provide you with improved services.
                                We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer
                                better site experiences and tools in the future.
